# Introduction

A new  preventative vaccine (covid91) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups consisting of Males, Females, just the drug users, and just those in the LGBTQ community. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine. Part of the information you need to compute is the so-called effectiveness of the drug for each subgroup of people. Include a 95% confidence interval of the effectiveness for each different subgroup. Structure your report in four sections each devoted to one of the four subgroups, use null and alternative hypothesis statements and correct statistical verbage when referencing p-values in conclusions.

# Males

```{r}
Males <- filter(Covid91, sex == "Man")
```

```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Males)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Males, type="percent")

```

The bar chart shows us that those who took the placebo got sick more than the males who took Covid91. We can see that the pink bar for placebo is almost double in size compared to the drug. This shows that the drug is effective for the Males group. 

## Numerical Summaries
```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Males)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

33% of the sick Males had the treatment, and 66.89% of those Males who got sick took the placebo. This is a 2 to 1 difference and lets us know that the treatment is in fact working. 

## Inferential  

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
Malesmod <- fisher.test(table1)
```

Based off Chi-squared test, the p-value is very small(2.2e-16). This indicates that we need to reject the null hypothesis and that there is a difference between the males who took the placebo and those Males who took the drug. 

```{r}
MaleEstimate <- Malesmod$estimate
Malelow <- Malesmod$conf.int[1]
Malehigh <- Malesmod$conf.int[2]

Malelowprob <- Malelow / (1 + Malelow) 
Maleloweffect <- Malelowprob * 100

Malehighprob <- Malehigh / (1+ Malehigh)
Malehigheffect <- Malehighprob *100 

Maleprob <- MaleEstimate / (1+ MaleEstimate)
MaleEffect <- Maleprob * 100
options(digits = 1)
```

The effectiveness of the Covid91 vaccine for Males is `r MaleEffect`. The confidence interval for males is `r Maleloweffect` to `r Malehigheffect`
